                <li>frosting</li>
                <li>8 oz cream cheese</li>
                <li> 3 to 4 cups sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

            <h3>steps<h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Place egg whites in a small bowl; let stand at room temperature 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375°. Thoroughly grease and flour inside of a 3D lamb cake pan.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy, 5-7 minutes. Beat in vanilla. In another bowl, sift flour, baking powder and salt together twice; add to creamed mixture alternately with milk, beating well after each addition.
                </li>
                <li>Add cream of tartar to egg whites; with clean beaters, beat on high speed just until stiff but not dry. Fold a fourth of the whites into batter, then fold in remaining whites.</li>
                <li>Gently transfer to bottom half of mold (the bottom half is the face of the lamb). Place top mold (back of lamb) on top, interlocking seams (make sure half with vent hole is on top to permit steam to escape). Place on a baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake until a toothpick inserted in vent hole comes out clean, 45-50 minutes. Let cool 15 minutes before removing to wire rack to cool completely.</li>
                <li>For frosting, in a large bowl, beat cream cheese and butter until smooth. Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar and vanilla. Frost cake. Attach sprinkles for eyes and nose; sprinkle body with coconut. If desired, decorate with additional coconut and jelly beans.</li>
